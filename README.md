# **ByteReaper - Linux Firewall**  
*A minimalistic linux firewall (ByteReaper) designed for low-level programming and experimentation.*

### **Note**
This project is **under development** and may have missing features or bugs.  
I am continuously improving itâ€”your feedback and support are invaluable!  

---

This project is based on the tutorial video created by **Dr. Jonas Birch** on YouTube.  
Dr. Birch is a phenomenal programmer whose work forms the foundation of this project.  
- Several header files, such as `birchutils.h`, were authored by him.  
- Definitions and `typedef`s used for typecasting in this project are directly derived from his work.  

Additionally, `ByteReaper.h` includes `birchutils.h`, and the functions within this header file rely on implementations found in `birchutils.c`. The project compiles in accordance with `birchutils.c`.  

You can download `birchutils.h` and `birchutils.c` from Dr. Birch's official repository: [https://repo.doctorbirch.com/](https://repo.doctorbirch.com/).  

A huge thanks to Dr. Birch for his invaluable resources and guidance!
